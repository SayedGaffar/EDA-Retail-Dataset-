# 🛍️ Retail Sales Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset. It was completed as part of an internship task with **TechNest**, with the objective to extract business insights from raw transactional data.

## Objectives

- Understand and summarize the structure of raw retail sales data.
- Identify sales trends, patterns, and seasonality using visualizations.
- Present key KPIs such as:
  - Total Sales over time
  - Revenue per Product Category
  - Average Order Value (AOV)
  - Revenue by Gender
  - Customer Age Distribution

##  Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

- 📈 **Sales Trend**: Line plots were used to observe total sales over time, highlighting monthly/seasonal sales fluctuations.
- 🗂️ **Category Analysis**: Bar charts were used to determine which product categories contributed the most to revenue.
- 💰 **Average Order Value**: The overall AOV was calculated to understand spending behavior per order.
- 👥 **Demographic Insights**:
  - Revenue split by **Gender**.
  - Age distribution of customers via histogram plots.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following fields:

- `Date`
- `Product Category`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Total Amount`
- `Transaction ID`
- `Customer ID`
- `Quantity`
- `Price per unit`
- (Additional fields used for aggregations and insights)

> *Note: The dataset used was internally provided during the internship and has been preprocessed for clarity.*

## Visualizations

All visualizations were generated using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to make the insights easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Deliverable

A complete **Jupyter Notebook** including:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory analysis
- Visualizations
- Summary statistics and business insights

## Conclusion

This analysis helped identify customer behavior, revenue drivers, and sales trends, which can be leveraged by retail businesses for data-driven decision-making, optimized marketing strategies, and better inventory management.
